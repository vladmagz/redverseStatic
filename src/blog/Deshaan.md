# Deshaan "Hardy" Taujer
![](assets/images/Deshaan/1.png)
More experiments in weird color schemes. Just learned about all the "academic" types of palletes (monochrome, opposite etc.) and decided to pick colors based on that.<br>
My thought process was the following:<br>
1. Got the Knights Kingdom wave 2 helmet (the face). Noticed how cool the sand blue streaks look on it. So i'm working with at least these two colors
2. Used bright yellow as the opposite of blue
3. Picked yellow for the "heavy duty" industrial shell. Sand blue is pretty mild so it works well as buffer. 
*I think this color scheme works well. If I'd redo this today, i'd make more "buffers" in sand blue between yellow parts so they are separated better*
