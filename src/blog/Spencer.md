# Spencer, the Drill Knight
![](assets/images/Spencer/1.png)Tried to utilize these drill parts as much as possible. Remember not liking any of the poses where the guy was holding his drill lance. That's why the weapon is on his back (again, like with [this guy](/blog/NotDrozo1)).
Props to lego making parts from Knights Kingdom mix so well with Nexo Knights
