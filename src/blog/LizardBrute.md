This is another [Lizardfolk](/blog/Lizard) character. Seemed fitting making another one for this kind of collab. I had this WIP around the old small technic panels (basically the whole belly) for years and just dusted it a bit. I quite enjoyed working in red & orange, but the overall model was quite awkward to pose in the end.
