# Wandering Soul, the Eternal
![](assets/images/BlackFantasy2/1.png)
My entry for bio-cup 2018 round one. My theme is black fantasy. Not my first rodeo in this theme, although the previous one was but a [tablescrap](/blog/BlackFantasy1). <br>
Inspired by [Portuguese man'o'war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_man_o%27_war). Basically this but black and with creepy eyes. It's a pretty straightforward build - make a blob -> put some eyes on it -> add tendrils.
