# Corruption
![](assets/images/BlackFantasy1/1.jpg)Well, I was hanging out at <a href="/photos/th3ch0s3n0n3/" rel="noreferrer nofollow">The Chosen One</a>'s place last weekend to take photos of our collab project with <a href="/photos/littletaggy/" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Tora</a>. So while these two slowpokes were tweaking the stands for their creatures, I got my hands on the enormously huge heap of Chosen's unsorted black lego pieces. And in an hour, this palmtop eldritch horror was born to turn our lives into a nightmare.
Later, I searched on flickr for black fantasy creations by other authors and realised that this fishing rod usage for legs isn't new and was used by <a href="/photos/nannanz/" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Nannan Z.</a>. But this was a tablescrap so whatever.
