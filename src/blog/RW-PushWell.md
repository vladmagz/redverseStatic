# CityCore RW-PushWell
![](assets/images/RW-PushWell/PushWell.png)
*Built wide and sturdy, RW-Pushwell handles cleanup and clearing with a steady touch. Its front scoop does the heavy lifting, pushing through rubble with care. It might hesitate now and then like many Duplons do - but never on the second pass.*<br><br>

*Before any road is paved, before any path is cleared, the CityCore RW-Series is on the job. They work the ground, prepare the site, and make sure the foundation is ready for everything that follows. Each member of this team takes a different approach, but they all share the same purpose: get the work done. Whether it’s pushing debris, digging deep, or hauling heavy loads, these machines know the value of getting things right the first time - no shortcuts, no hesitation.*
