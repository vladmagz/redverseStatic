# Bell Beast
![](assets/images/HollowKnight5/1.png)
Crazy to realize that this is my 5th [Hollow Knight](/blog/HollowKnight4)-themed build. I guess this game actually made that big of an impact on me. Trying to rationalize it, I think it's the melancholic vibe it has to is really resonates within me. Can't say enough to Team Cherry for making such a great impact on me.<br><br>

Back to the build. It's the Bell Beast! My cute little (not very) means of transportation in Silksong!

Aaand it's the second time I faced a huge challenge designing Hornet's mask! The shape is crazy hard to replicate! Making mini-hornet was a bit of a challenge since there are so many cool versions made in the community too. The hype around the game was crazy!<br>
Anyway that was incredibly fast for me, given how slow I usually am! But the Bell Beast from Silksong might be my favorite doggy ever so I was fast as wind, haha. I also feel like the beast's head is a bit unpolished since there are gaps but i kinda like them. The gaps on the front kinda look like nostrils, it's cute! My guess is I'll work on a couple more lego Hollow Knight builds and take a break, switching to a different topic

Reminder to add WIP pics later!
