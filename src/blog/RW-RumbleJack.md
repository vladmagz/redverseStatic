# CityCore RW-RumbleJack
![](assets/images/RW-RumbleJack/RumbleJack.png)
*RW-Rumblejack may be a Quattroid on the smaller side, but its jackhammer never quits, pounding away with a noise that rattles teeth and nerves alike. Quick on its feet and bristling with gear, it tears up the ground before anyone’s ready. The rest of the crew might roll their eyes, but when the pavement needs cracking wide open, Rumblejack’s relentless rhythm makes sure nothing stays standing.*<br><br>

*Before any road is paved, before any path is cleared, the CityCore RW-Series is on the job. They work the ground, prepare the site, and make sure the foundation is ready for everything that follows. Each member of this team takes a different approach, but they all share the same purpose: get the work done. Whether it’s pushing debris, digging deep, or hauling heavy loads, these machines know the value of getting things right the first time - no shortcuts, no hesitation.*
