# Chainsaw Man
![](assets/images/CSMDenji/main.png)
Here goes the big guy! This actually is the biggest system build I've ever done yet.<br>
I've really enjoyed the first season of Chainsaw Man anime and it got me  hooked on the manga too. One of the top faves for me.<br>
The model is big, quite unstable and somewhat fragile in some places. A couple of incidents of this guy falling really makes me want to pay attention to stability of the builds in the future.

Obviously, it all started with the head build, but I should've expected that the whole model is going to be this huge. Was a crazy hard challenge though

The stand sucks by the way. That's why i shamefully hide it in the "money shot". But you might've wanted look closer at his sneakers so there you go!

And here's the money shot but without the background that screams colors in your face. It was fun to edit it in post, adding all the color splashes and the hieroglyphics. Big props to [Ari](https://www.flickr.com/photos/188495704@N06/) for giving helpful advice on color correction and textures.
