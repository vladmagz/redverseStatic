# Aaralyn, princess of the Deep Sea
![](assets/images/Aaralyn/1.png)Little princess of the Deep Dark. Built for Biocup 2020 Round 1. The theme is "Cnidarea".<br>
Isn't my first medusa-adjacent build, I had something like [Portuguese Man-o-War](/blog/BlackFantasy2) last year. It was Black Fantasy-themed so I decided to make the polar opposite to it - a frail and shiny creature of light living in total darkness.
I'm really proud of the translucent effect on the eyes. Has this marbled look.
