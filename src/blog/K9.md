# K-9 Multi-purpose Support Unit
![](assets/images/K9/regularshot.jpg)Team Zero Hour: Animilitary

Mainly used to provide supplies and medicinal assistance to the front lines, it's not unusual to see these units acting as the vanguard due to their robust and agile build. Formidable on it's own, the K-9 unit is usually seen operating in squads.<br><br>

My entry for the Space Jam 2020 contest. This is a group entry and we actually won in this category!

The build is pretty stable but nothing extraordinary. The back legs and the head are a bit fragile. The body is built around 3 parallel long axles so it doesn't break that easily. the front legs' articulation is a bit weird due to the big pauldrons. And the front paws are anatomically incorrect (they lack one of the joints)  
I think these are all the issues I left in this build

And here's the "group shot" I cobbled together quick. One day I'll take it as a post-editing study and rework. It has a lot of issues
