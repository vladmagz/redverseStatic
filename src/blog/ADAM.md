# AD.AM
![](assets/images/ADAM/1.png)
Cyberpunk before it was dead!
That was my first build that exploded on social media. 400 faves on flickr was huge by lego MOCer standarts! And it still is now that fllickr is slowly dying.<br>
The setup i used to take pictures and achieve this slight reflection was crazy! I took a semi-glossy sheet of hardboard (yes, the one used in furniture) bent it by strapping rope from both sides, making a convex shape and that was my background!<br>
The sheet was huge and unwieldy but I was very happy with the result. If the part of my brain that is responsible for fantasy will die, I will remake this fella
