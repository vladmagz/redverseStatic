# E.VA
![](assets/images/EVA/1.png)The counterpart to AD.AM. Who would've guessed.<br>
Got a bunch of comments how you can't see black on black and I agree lol! But I've lost the original files and any more editing will probably ruin the picture even more. Let this be the testament to my mistakes in learning object photography.

I was very much proud of the rear view. Mostly because of the spine. It was supposed to be able to move but I've lost this functionality while shaping the body. Oh well
