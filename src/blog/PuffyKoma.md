Every month has it's own community theme for MOC builders. March is for Tachikomas. I just watched big hero 6 and really wanted to make something like Baymax, something marshmallowy.
Also considered adding the iconic three eyes on its head but the boat-stud part's surface was tricky so I gave up quickly
