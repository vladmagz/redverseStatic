A year later after the [first "oldschool" collab](/blog/RetroGrade) it's finally time for the second wave! Check out the others too:<br>

You might've noticed my builds have a huge part in this collab. I went a bit nuts playing with ancient parts and churned out 3 builds in a short period.<br>
This one is based around the idea of these mid-torso supports and what can be worked out from that. Also these bright colors and busy colors gave me a headache hence the name "Migraine".
