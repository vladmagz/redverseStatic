First time I got enough of these fun gunmetal Bionicle armor pieces. Of course I'll have to spam them lol! I think they looked good on the spine of this guy. <br>
Oh and using them on the lower jaw was an unusual choice for me since I usually try not to lose poseability when sculpting. But the ragged look sold this choice to me. <br>
You know what also was fun? Balancing the guy! Apparently raptor-type dinosaurs had their center of mass right between the hip joints so all I had to do is to make the tail long and girthy enough so that the guy won't topple onto its head.
