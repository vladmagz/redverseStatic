# Sean Greasysprocket the Space Goblin
![](assets/images/Goblin/1.png)
In the flickr comment section of my [previous build](/blog/Witch) I got a lot of questions on how specific connections work. And I wanted a more creative way to show the "how-to" for these techs. That's how the idea of making a space goblin came up in my mind. He's basically the guy who cobbles together all this illegal stuff. Because you know, Goblin technology is... pretty unique.<br><br>
He's probably living in my head and continues his work up to this day
