# CityCore RW-GrubJaw
![](assets/images/RW-GrubJaw/GrubJaw.png)
*RW-Grubjaw digs where others hesitate. Its long arms swing low and wide, scooping, dragging, breaking apart what’s no longer needed. It works best alone, digging deep without a word. And when you need some dirt moving, this Structor gets it gone.*<br><br>
*Before any road is paved, before any path is cleared, the CityCore RW-Series is on the job. They work the ground, prepare the site, and make sure the foundation is ready for everything that follows. Each member of this team takes a different approach, but they all share the same purpose: get the work done. Whether it’s pushing debris, digging deep, or hauling heavy loads, these machines know the value of getting things right the first time - no shortcuts, no hesitation.*
