# Chilly Willy

Another big change in genre - probably my first build trying to represent a character from an existing license. Which is not a bionicle obviously. <br>
This MOC is very important to me - I've learnt I actually can follow a reference. This almost needs a different skillset comparing to designing characters out of Lego from scratch.

That red flex pipe used for the hat worked pretty well, in my opinion.
I also got a lot of requests to make instructions for this guy, promised I'd do this and never did. Kinda hate myself to this day. <br>
Maybe this gestalt won't be resolved until I actually do this.
