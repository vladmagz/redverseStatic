# Armadillo
![](assets/images/Armadillo/1.jpg)
Got to the local pick-a-brick-like store and found a bunch of these 8x8 dishes for cheap. When putting parts in my bag I stacked the dishes that way and well, you see the armadillo now

The critter is a bit too flat to look like a real armadillo but the texture these dishes create was very pleasant to look at.
