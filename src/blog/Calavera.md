# The Calavera Caballeros
![](assets/images/Calavera/1.png)
My entry for round 2 of biocup 2018. The theme was Dia de Los Muertos so I made a little living dead band to celebrate!<br>
They are mostly the same build, except some accessories and limb lengths.

I also gotta be clear - I cheated on that biocup round. The thing is that I've never built the two of them **at the same time**. I just built one, and made all the preparations to rebuild it into the second one. Then took pictures of them in turns, with the same lighting and all. Even positioned them correctly. I think the result is indescribable from the real (theoretical) combo.<br>
This way I saved some time on building the second one from scratch. And money because the parts for the jacket sides are hella expensive!<br><br>
*Doot!*
