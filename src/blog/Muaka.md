We're continuing our roll with another collab! And boy, that's a big one! Muaka was one of my first Lego sets and I loved it dearly. It was huge by the standarts of 6-year-old me, it had the coolest ever function I've seen in a lego model (snapping jaw, what the hell?!) and it was a great starter pack for me to start building my own stuff.

I'm mostly satisfied with how it looks, although I'd make a bit of color differentiation on the belly so that the legs would become more readable instead of "black on black"

The model actually has this "function" of the hind legs transforming into treads. This is another nod to the original.<br>
Looks a bit awkward but I didn't want to sacrifice the cat-like menacing stance for the function. <br><br>
As a little bonus, here are the WIP pics of my first attempt at Muaka a whole whopping 5 years ago. Crazy how much my approach to building has changed.
