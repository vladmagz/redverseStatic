"In the year 2037, the new frontier of virtual reality was opened..."<br>

Oh my, I felt so tired after finishing this build. I failed 3 attempts of building a proper stand for this girl. Basically it's a new type of VR that affects all of your senses. Hence the name.
Inspired by Giger, Cyberpunk 2077 and the Matrix.<br>

My first attempt at making a substantial sidebuild to the main figurine. I just got enough technic pieces to make a base as big as this. The character's body ended up being a bit messy but i tried to hide it behind the gray color, as if she was a cyborg and her upper body is mechanical. In retrospect I wish I had more system pieces to make the organic areas smoother.
![](assets/images/SensumRift/1.jpg)The obvious question you'd ask would be "what the hell are those pink noodles up top?". Aaaand that's Clikits! Got them in bulk not long ago and they almost look like fiber optics. Fiddling around with them was a bit of a pain though.
![](assets/images/SensumRift/2.jpg)The "console" was a new tech involving color for me. The opaque plates represent "shining" LEDs and the transparent ones are idle. I think this effect worked well and it's readable that the red bar is dangerously high there.

Oh and look! more of these friction extenders you could've seen in my Flywheel MOC.<br>
*As I'm writing this post 10 years after actually creating this thing I kinda want to rework this model. Now with new skills and the ability to use classic System. Well, we'll see, but I'm adding this project to my backlog*
