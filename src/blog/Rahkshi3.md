This one was very tricky! The power I was working with was cyclone, so I had to create a character around something that can create heavy gusts of wind. So I went with huge propeller blades as a weapon. <br>
But making it just a spear would've been not very readable so I went with full 4-bladed turbine. And it transforms into a glaive.

And they also split. I think, it's a fun gimmick. I've really enjoyed the whole series and the challenge of overblowing the power of Rahkshi out of proportions. To the point that the powers take over the character design.
