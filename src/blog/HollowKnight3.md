# Hornet
![](assets/images/HollowKnight3/1.png)
After the long wait, Hollow Knight silksong is finally out! And a few weeks after, when my hands are sore from dying from so many attempts at the insanely hard bosses (looking at you Groal!!!), I'm taking a break from the game and **finally** finishing all my attempts at making Hornet. Her mask is crazy hard to recreate because of all the subtle angles. In my latest attempt I went throug 9 diffeerent approaches, I think. Until I figured it out (mostly).<br>
Really satisfied with the result here. And good to get back to another [Hollow Knight build](/blog/HollowKnight2)
