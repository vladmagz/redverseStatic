Got a lot of Hero Factory friction extenders. Obviously they stack and the fun thing about it is that the extender chain is flexible! <br>
It doesn't bend that much but you can get pretty fun curves. Here's the most basic attempt at making a monowheel bike using this tech. I really want to reuse it in the future sometime.
