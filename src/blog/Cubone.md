# Pokémon #104 - Cubone

![](assets/images/Cubone/cubone_final1.png)A lil' guy for change. The whole pokemon series was one big study in following existing concepts in several different scales. Combined with playing around with my favorite creature designs.

Just like with my [Golisopod](/blog/Golisopod) and [Gyarados](/blog/Gyarados), this guy exists in physical form too. Here's a pic I took before publishing [instructions](https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-238173/Redverse/cubone/#details) for him.
