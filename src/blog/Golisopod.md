# Pokemon #768 - Golisopod
![](assets/images/Golisopod/Golisopod_final.png)And some Wimpods as a small bonus :)<br><br>
I got really tired of being limited by the small temporary apartment I live in and the being away from my Lego collection.<br>
And until now I really overlooked the opportunity of building digitally. And boy oh boy, in limited resources and with the ambitious ideas of relatively large Lego builds, Stud.io is a major lifesaver. Thankfully, I was already familiar with Bricklink naming scheme so navigating Stud.io color pallete wasn't as hard as it could've been.<br>
Aside from that the build process was pretty straightforward. Really grateful for the lack of gravity when you build digitally, haha! Less constraints when searching for the exact part you need. <br>
The hardest thing was to actually learn Blender because the in-house Stud.io renderer sucks! Thanks to [Ivan](https://www.flickr.com/photos/brick_heretic/) and [Marko](https://www.flickr.com/photos/cezium/) for the huge help in learning the ropes.
