# Sergeant Maria Magnificenta the Military Witch
![](assets/images/Witch/1.png)Based off of some anime art I found. The funniest thing is that I totally misread the character's lower face (the half that was not hidden by the hat) as a big eye. <br>
So she ended up being more western-looking, compared to the original anime look.<br><br>
Aside from that, it's a pretty small build revolving around new interesting connections I've been figuring out lately
