# LRSK

Probably overthought this concept a bit too much and didn't feel any resonance within people seeing it.<br>
Still think the idea of a rogue knife-throwing character that has knives attached all over the body is the idea of high potential.

Honestly, got very tired of trying to make this model work well and struggled between making it "look okay" and "not being derivative".<br>
This was the moment when I really got tired messing with the same old over-specialized bionicle pieces for 20 years. I felt this is the moment to move on.
