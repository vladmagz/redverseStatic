# CityCore MK-Rotomix
![](assets/images/MK-Rotomix/concrete.png)
*With twin mixing drums embedded in each forearm, MK-Rotomix is always in motion - quietly, steadily blending concrete as it works. It's calm and methodical, laying down smooth lines and solid foundations without a drop wasted. To this Duplon, the job’s not done until every layer feels just right underfoot.<br><br>
Before the sparks fly and the skyline begins to grow, the MK-Series arrives. These Builders don’t just follow instructions - they create the cities of the future. Each unit brings a different rhythm to the worksite, from the steady churn of mixers to the precise lifts of cranes. They build with patience, coordination, and precision - because a strong city needs solid foundations.*
