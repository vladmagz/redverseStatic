# Ikir, Creature of Fire
![](assets/images/Ikir/Ikir1.jpg)
This is a result of collab between <a href="/photos/th3ch0s3n0n3/" rel="noreferrer nofollow">The Chosen One</a>, <a href="/photos/littletaggy/" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Tora</a> and me. Basically, these are the reimagining of 2016 Bionicle creature sets. Each one of us made two of them. <br>
Aaaaand it's partspam again. I got a bunch of these Chima phoenix sets and these flame pieces are pretty nifty.

They work alright as feathers. <br>
I know, I know the eyes are weird but I had no idea what else would work okay as eyes. I wish I had some printed tiles with eye patterns or something. But us poor fellas make do 😂<br>
I've lost some of the original set's functionality and traded it for more biological animalistic look.<br>
*I wonder how I'd approach this project now? Probably would spend 10x more time polishing it and achieving next to nothing in terms of improvements*<br>
Oh and the collab rule was to make some "elemental landscape" so here's an ugly burnt tree!
