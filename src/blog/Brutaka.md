Sooo it's a long stretch from the original [Brutaka](https://biosector01.com/wiki/Brutaka) but bear with me, I'll explain. <br>
That year, in 2006 we got our boy Brutaka and the chonkster Axonn, right? Axonn was beefy and meaty, while Brutaka was supposed to be thin but still quite strong and, most impotantly, hardy/tough. And what can be more enduring than bugs? Add to this the fact that his mask has something that looks like mandibles and now you get me.<br>
I went with full insect look

The glaive ended up being a bit weird and not straight but it's a fun shape so this redeems it for me.
