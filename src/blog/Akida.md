# Akida, Creature of Water
![](assets/images/Akida/Akida2.jpg)
This is a result of collab between <a href="/photos/th3ch0s3n0n3/" rel="noreferrer nofollow">The Chosen One</a>, <a href="/photos/littletaggy/" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Tora</a> and me. Basically, these are the reimagining of 2016 Bionicle creature sets. Each one of us made two of them. 

*Writing this blogpost almost 10 years after creating this, I think this little build actually aged pretty good. There isn't much to it, but also not much to fix with the availability of cool new system parts*

*Also, in retrospect, I think this was my first skill spike. Probably thanks to the collaboration and tight contact with my friends. More organic shapes while using these messy Technic and Bionicle parts, better color blocking. Also close to the happiest time in my life. These were happy-poor-student times, when I was the closest with my best friends, when I've met the huge international Lego community. Life also was easier back then. <br>
I thing I got too sappy. Back to bonkles! Fish, go swim!*
