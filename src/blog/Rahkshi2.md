The build was supposed to be more complicated, actually. I wanted to play on the fact that the Rahkshi itself is one complex laser gun. So it merges its face with its staff to shoot heavier beams. Also wanted it to be covered with wires that deliver energy straight to its core.<br>
Again, hit the wall of too high ambitions. Oh well
