# Heretic H-02
![](assets/images/Heretic/1.png)This was supposed to be a Secret Santa build and I had to post this in january. It is july now. It's better late than never I guess? <br><br>

Anyway<br><br>

This is a remake of one of the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/prhymus/4765617981/">most iconic bionicle mocs</a> , in my opinion, and a tribute to my good friend, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/prhymus/">Cameron</a> (aka Primus). His builds inspired me for years and still do. Hats off to you, master of black robots! :p
