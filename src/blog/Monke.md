# Sun Wukong, the Monkey King
![](assets/images/Monke/1.png)A legendary figure best known as one of the main characters in the 16th-century Chinese novel Journey to the West (西遊記/西游记) and many later stories and adaptations. The Monkey King's origins predate the novel and can be traced back both to the Monkey-God, Hanuman, from the Hindu epic, the Ramayana as well as from the Song dynasty.

In the novel, he is a monkey born from a stone who acquires supernatural powers through Taoist practices. After rebelling against heaven and being imprisoned under a mountain by the Buddha, he later accompanies the monk Tang Sanzang on a journey to retrieve Buddhist sutras from the West (India) where Buddha and his followers reside.

My entry for Biocup 2020 Round 2. The theme is East Asian mythology.
One of the builds I'm more happy with. A decent fusion of CCBS and system, with some fun part usage, clothwork and a color-scheme that works.
