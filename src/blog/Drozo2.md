# Defoli Grun the Guard Captain
![](assets/images/Drozo2/1.png)
As I mentioned in [this post](/blog/Drozo1), I really liked this color scheme and wanted to explore this concept of alien species a bit more. So, this is the second iteration! <br>
The only thing that is a bit confusing in these two is that you can't really understand, which color represents their "skin" and which one is "armor". In retrospect, should've differentiated them a bit better.<br>
*I actually still want to make a third one, "the assassin", to complete the series. Never did this as of the end of 2025*
