# Sahrag, the Bohrok Nui
![](assets/images/BohrokNui/1.png)Domain: Southern Islands<br><br>

Siblings of the Bahrag slumber silently in their own hidden nests, patiently awaiting their next command.<br>
Connected by powerful telepathic links, their collective reach may spread across the entire Matoran Universe: <br>
You wake one, you wake them all. <br><br>
