![](assets/images/Kazma/kazma.png)The champion of OZ Super Rumble Race, here to beat his own speed record again for the 17th time.<br><br>

My Biocup 2020 finals entry. I had to mashup at least one entry from the redemption round and at least one entry from the main rounds.
Here I based the whole entry on <a href="https://flic.kr/p/2jkD4hZ" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Marge & Allium by Yannick Godts</a> by making <a href="https://summerwars.fandom.com/wiki/King_Kazma" rel="noreferrer nofollow">King Kazma from Summer Wars</a> <br>
And the bike is a vague mashup of a snail, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/kingmarshy/49931841162/">The More Things Change, The More They Stay The Same by Kingmarshy</a> and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/188495704@N06/49927494432/">Blue Dynamite by buttloaf_builds</a>

A lot of flex tube and pneumatics went there to make the snail shell.
