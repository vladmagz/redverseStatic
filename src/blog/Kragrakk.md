# Kragrakk the Savage
![](assets/images/Kragrakk/1.png)
I think this was the period in my life when I was on a roll, churning out builds one week after another. Having a lot of energy and curiosity to play with new parts did magic.<br><br>
*After that, my building slowed down heavily, mostly because I always wanted to "surpass myself" in some way. Almost lost all the fun in Lego back then. Horrifying...*
