Basically the point was to show the possibilities of overtextured early technic parts, especially now when we had the extra income to order the excessive amounts of these parts and SPAM! <br>
We called this collab ThanksG1ving. That was a fun challenge!

My attempt at this was mostly based around the technic triangular connectors which make some cool radiator-like textures.
The posture was probably inspired by nobu_tary's recent builds, with mechs, strong crotch-thrust poses etc.
