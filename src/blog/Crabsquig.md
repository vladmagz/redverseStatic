Very late birthday build for <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/brick_heretic/">Ivan</a>. Happy birthday dude!!!<br>
BTW I moved to a different country! Took just a bag of "the basics" from my huge Lego collection. Added a couple sets bought at the new place and a couple spare parts from [Marko](https://www.flickr.com/photos/cezium/)  who's now my neighbor (wtf?!).<br>
This MOC is obviously as simple as it's possible but I'm still surprised it's mostly a coherent character.
