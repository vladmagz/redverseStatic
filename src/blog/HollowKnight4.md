# Lace
![](assets/images/HollowKnight4/1.png)Another [Hollow Knight]() build under my belt! Soon to get the full *pantheon*<br>
Well, I'd love to show more of the mid-build pics, but Lace was built over just 2 nights which is a lightning speed for me. So this is all I have. If you are tired of all the fuss around Silksong I have bad news for you because I just cant stop building characters from the game lol.

Here's the moment where I got the parts needed (just rushed to the nearest lego shop for the Tiger Artwork)

Aaand it's almost done. This is how builds have to be done - quick!
