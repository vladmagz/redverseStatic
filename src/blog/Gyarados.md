# Pokémon #130 - Gyarados
![](assets/images/Gyarados/1.png)Going through my favorite Pokemon and it's time for my boi Gyarados. Always had him in my team in Fire Red and in other games. Got back into Pokemon Go last year and found my ancient perfect IV Magikarp. So this build is dedicated to this Karp who waited 7 years to be evolved, haha :)

In terms of poseability - it's head, neck segment and first 2 segments after that are slightly poseable with then big ratchet rotation joints. Same applies to the last 7 segments of its tail. The middle section is a solid chunk with techniс frame inside.

The model was made crazy fast, in just 2 weeks or so. These are crazy speeds for me. Thankfully Stud.io off-loads some of the tougher aspects of Lego building in large scale.

Any building new stuff just went on hiatus right after the parts for the guy arrived. Yep I've decided to make the physical version. Mostly because I wanted to participate in a Lego expo in Belgrade. 
Took me over a month just to tweak the model to achieve the stability I needed.
