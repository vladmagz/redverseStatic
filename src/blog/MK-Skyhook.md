# CityCore MK-Skyhook
![](assets/images/MK-Skyhook/crane.png)
*MK-Skyhook towers over the site, scanning from above with steady focus. Its telescopic arm stretches far and ends in a precise, claw-like grip. It moves with efficiency, lifting and placing girders with a sense of purpose. Skyhook doesn’t waste words - or movements.<br><br>
Before the sparks fly and the skyline begins to grow, the MK-Series arrives. These Builders don’t just follow instructions - they create the cities of the future. Each unit brings a different rhythm to the worksite, from the steady churn of mixers to the precise lifts of cranes. They build with patience, coordination, and precision - because a strong city needs solid foundations.*
